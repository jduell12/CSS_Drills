            <h2>Wild Magic</h2>
            <p>Thirteen-year-old DaIne has always had a knack with animals, but it's not until she's forced to leave home that
                she realizes it's more than a knack -- it's magic. With this wild magic, not only can Daine speak to animals,
                but also she can make them obey her. Daine takes a job handling horses for the Queen's Riders, where she
                meets the master mage Numair and becomes his student. </p>
            <p>Under Numair's guidance, Daine explores the scope of her magic. But she begins to sense other beings too: immortals.
                These bloodthirsty monsters have been imprisoned in the Divine Realms for the past four hundred years, but
                now someone has broken the barrier. It's up to Daine and her friends to defend their world from an immortal
                attack.</p>

            <h2>Ender's Game</h2>
            <p>In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child
                geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew "Ender" Wiggin lives with his kind but
                distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine.
                Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut--young Ender
                is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.</p>
            <p>Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles
                in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers, Ender suffers greatly from
                isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien
                invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he
                remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. </p>
            <p>Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the
                Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for
                almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways.
                Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If the world survives, that is.</p>

            <h2>The Alchemyst</h2>
            <p> The truth: Nicholas Flamel was born in Paris on September 28, 1330.</p>

            <p>The legend: Nicholas Flamel discovered the secret of eternal life.</p>

            <p>
                The records show that he died in 1418. But his tomb is empty. Nicholas Flamel lives. But only because he has been making
                the elixir of life for centuries. The secret of eternal life is hidden within the book he protectsâ€”the Book
                of Abraham the Mage. It's the most powerful book that has ever existed. In the wrong hands, it will destroy
                the world. That's exactly what Dr. John Dee plans to do when he steals it. Humankind won't know what's happening
                until it's too late. And if the prophecy is right, Sophie and Josh Newman are the only ones with the power
                to save the world as we know it.
            </p>
            <p> Sometimes legends are true. And Sophie and Josh Newman are about to find themselves in the middle of the greatest
                legend of all time.</p>

            <h2>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</h2>
            <p>Harry Potter has no idea how famous he is. That's because he's being raised by his miserable aunt and uncle who

                his illustrious birthright. From the surprising way he is greeted by a lovable giant, to the unique curriculum
                and colorful faculty at his unusual school, Harry finds himself drawn deep inside a mystical world he never
                knew existed and closer to his own noble destiny.</p>
